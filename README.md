# subtidal

A command line utility for batch downloading subtitles for all movies in a central media folder.

Walks the file tree, visiting subfolders and downloading subtitles for each movie if they do not already exist.

Changes subtitle names so that they are automatically recognized by Roku Media Player.

Makes quick work of central media folders and entire hard drives alike.
